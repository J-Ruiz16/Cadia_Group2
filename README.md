Brief:This program uses a game struct and library class to read from a file, write to a file, sort, find, delete

Design decisions:

-followed the format specified on canvas assignment

Challenges:

-Had dificulty with reading the data one line at a time from a file
-had trouble with the sorting by title on the insert_sorted method
-Had trouble finding a game by keywords of a title and not just the title itself


How work was shared:
-We split the work. One was in charge of reading and writing and the other was in charge of the sorting and pushing
-Let her do the file reading then I came in and did the finding games by title/genre/keyword/etc
-Fixed up a few things that were missing and editied the code a tiny bit to make it a little more readable


Run program: run make then ./game_library
